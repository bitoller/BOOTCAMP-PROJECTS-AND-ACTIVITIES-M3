# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Full Stack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from No Stack all the way to a Full Stack Developer. This repository will have almost everything I did during the `third module`, or `M3` for short.<br />

<hr />

The `S` stands for `SPRINT` <strong>e.g.</strong> `S1` means `SPRINT 1`.<br />
The numbers are the activity numbers. Every activity has a name and a number.<br />
The `M` stands for `Modules` <strong>e.g.</strong> `M3` means `Module 3`. That's how the bootcamp curriculum is separated.<br />
→ All the activities and projects have their own readme files with instructions inside their respective folders.

## S1-36-M3 - 03/27/23 - NU KENZIE
For this activity I had to code a Finances Management Page based on an example given from Figma using Reactjs. You can use this application to keep track of your finances. You can select between money going in or out and name them accordingly. The application will also calculate the total balance.<br />

## S2-14-M3 - 04/03/23 - HAMBURGUERIA KENZIE
For this activity I had to code a Burger Shop based on an example given from Figma using Reactjs. You can add products to the cart, you can also remove them all from the cart at once or one by one. You can search for the product by its name or category using the search bar.<br />

## S3-11-M3 - 04/17/23 - KENZIEHUB
For this activity I had to code a Hub Page based on an example given from Figma using Reactjs. You can sign up with your email and password and then sign in to access your personal hub. When signed in, you'll be able to see your course module and the technologies you know, including your level of knowledge. You can add new technologies, you can edit your level of knowledge about existing technologies and you can delete them as well.<br />

## S5-18-M3 - 04/24/23 - HAMBURGUERIA 2.0
For this activity I had to code a Burger Shop based on an example given from Figma using Reactjs and TypeScript. You can sign up with your email and password and then sign in to access your personal account. When signed in, you can add products to the cart, you can also remove them all from the cart at once or one by one. You can search for the product by its name or category using the search bar. The CSS was already done.<br />

## S7-01-M3 - 05/08/23 - FUREVER HOMES
For the module's final project, we were divided into groups and given free rein to choose what we wanted to do. We decided, as a group, to create a website to aid animal adoption. We wanted to have a space for people who rescued animals from the streets to put them up for adoption, and at the same time, we wanted to allow people looking for a new pet to come to the website and adopt an animal. We used agile methodologies like SCRUM and Kanban to organize ourselves. We created our own Figma from scratch and our fake API from scratch. Then we started coding the website using Reactjs and TypeScript. You can create an account and use it to sign in. You can see a list of pets that were registered in the database. You can open their cards to see more information and eventually adopt them, but only if they haven't already been adopted. You can filter them by name using the search bar or by type using the buttons right on top of the animal list. You can put an animal up for adoption using the button on top of the page, and more.<br />
