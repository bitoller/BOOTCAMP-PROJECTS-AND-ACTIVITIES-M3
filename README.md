# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Full Stack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from No Stack all the way to a Full Stack Developer. This repository will have almost everything I did during the `third module`, or `M3` for short.<br />

<hr />

The `S` stands for `SPRINT` <strong>e.g.</strong> `S1` means `SPRINT 1`.<br />
The numbers are the activity numbers. Every activity has a name and a number.<br />
The `M` stands for `Modules` <strong>e.g.</strong> `M3` means `Module 3`. That's how the bootcamp curriculum is separated.<br />
→ All the activities and projects have their own readme files with instructions inside their respective folders.

## S1-36-M3 - 03/27/23 - "[NU KENZIE](https://nu-kenzie-bitoller.vercel.app/)"
For my next activity I had to code a Finances Management App based on an example given from Figma using Reactjs. You can use this application to keep track of your finances. You can select between money going in or out and name them accordingly. The application will also calculate the total balance.<br />
